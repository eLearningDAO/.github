## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
eLearningDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on decentralised e-Learning. 

It supports and coordinates the development of a new open-source decentralised e-Learning platform.

eLearningDAO objectives are:
- enable sovereignty of the user's learning data
- share revenue coming from courses, among all contributors such as teachers, examiners, content creators, content publishers, software developers, etc.
- share ownership of the platform and the learning materials between creators
- make recertification processes obsolete
- enable the reputation of user's curricula instead of relying on the brand of the institutes
- acknowledge the authorship of the co-created learning materials
- support the quality of learning material and the quality of knowledge examination through collective intelligence
- reduce the monopoly of Ed-Tech giants

### This is the general design of how it distributes revenue among stakeholders who have provided learning material, testing & verification and publishing services.
