## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
eLearningDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on decentralised e-Learning. 

It supports and coordinates the development of a new open-source decentralised e-Learning platform.

eLearningDAO objectives:
- Allow data sovereignty of the user learning journey 
- Propose an alternative to the monopoly of the Ed-Tech giants
- Make recertification processes obsolete
- Enable reputation of user's curricula instead of relying on academy branding
- Knowledge verification by reputation and verifiable learning path to mitigate the abuse of AI tools
- Acknowledge authorship of the co-created learning materials
- Support the quality of learning material and the quality of knowledge verification through a novel gamification process
- Share the revenue among all of stakeholders who participated, such as teachers, verifiers, content creators, content publishers, platform developers, etc.
- Share ownership of the platform and contents
